🔰 Project Bellato Idle: RF Online NostalgiaAn unofficial, single-player mobile idle RPG inspired by the classic mechanics and atmosphere of Rising Force Online (RFO), focusing initially on the Bellato Federation race.🚀 Project OverviewThe core gameplay centers around passive progression and strategic pre-battle preparation. The player controls a single Bellato character in a persistent world, setting them to automatically battle monsters in dangerous regions. The primary player input is managing inventory, upgrading gear, choosing the next hunting ground, and advancing their character's class and skills.Key FeaturesSingle-Player Focused: No multiplayer or live PvP, allowing for a relaxed, self-paced experience.Idle Auto-Battle: Select a zone and let your character grind for experience, money, and rare loot until they die or the player intervenes.Deep RPG Progression: Detailed character sheet including Level, Class, PT (Proficiency), Inventory, and a Class-specific Spell Tree.Loot & Crafting Loop: Drops from monsters are used for selling or as materials for crafting superior gear.Dynamic Map Unlocks: New, higher-level zones become available as the player levels up, offering increasing risk and reward.🎮 Gameplay MechanicsThis section details the primary systems in the game.1. The Core Combat LoopSelect Region & Monster: The player navigates a world map (starting with basic Bellato territory like the Solus System). They choose the zone (e.g., Outskirts of Sette) and optionally select a specific monster type to prioritize.Auto-Battle Begins: The game enters an Idle State. The character automatically engages the selected monsters.Combat is resolved based on character Attack/Defense stats, PT levels, and the casting of skills/spells from the Spell Tree.The game displays a log or basic visual feedback: [Player] hits [Monster] for X damage!, [Monster] drops Y Gold and Z Item..Loot and EXP: Monsters grant Experience (for character level), PT (for skill proficiency), and drop Currency/Items/Crafting Materials.Death State: Combat continues indefinitely until the player's HP reaches 0. The player is automatically returned to the Town with all earned loot and a small experience/currency penalty (to encourage strategic zone selection).Offline Gains: The game should calculate a period of simulated progress (e.g., up to 8 hours) while the player is offline, rewarding them upon log-in.2. Character Progression & Class SystemThe foundation of the Bellato character's power is based on the original RFO system:Base ClassLevel 30 Advancement (Examples)FocusWarriorMyrmidon, SentryMelee DPS, TankingRangerDesperado, SniperRanged Physical DPSSpiritualistPsyper, ChandraMagic DPS, Force/BuffsSpecialistDriver, CraftsmanUtility, Crafting, MAU (Future)Level (LVL): Increases base stats (HP, SP, etc.) and unlocks new content (Zones, Quests, Class Advancements).Proficiency (PT): Skills like Melee PT, Ranged PT, Force PT (Magic) level up passively through use. Higher PT unlocks better skills in the Spell Tree and allows the use of higher-grade gear.3. Town Functions (The Upgrade Cycle)The town is the player's hub for active input:Merchant: Sells basic consumables (Potions, Scrolls) and starter gear.Quest Master: Provides the main progression path. Quests often involve killing a specific number of monsters or collecting a certain item, rewarding large EXP/Gold/Rare Materials.Inventory/Equipment: Where the player manages their loot. The most crucial decision point in the loop.Crafting: Blacksmith NPC (or Specialist character) uses monster materials and Ore (e.g., Talic Ore) to create powerful Intense or Rare gear.🛠️ Technical DetailsThis section is for contributors and developers looking to set up and modify the project.Tech StackGame Engine: [Specify the Engine, e.g., Unity, Godot, Flutter, etc.]Programming Language: [Specify the Language, e.g., C#, C++, Dart, Kotlin, etc.]Data/Database: [How is item/monster data stored? e.g., JSON files, SQLite]Build Targets: Mobile (iOS/Android)Installation & SetupBash# 1.
